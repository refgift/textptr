The refgift/ptr uses random data for it's input. Random data is equivalent to equilibrium of the reality. You should start with that before you get into this. 

This refgift/textptr uses the text on the command line as an argument for input. It uses the same perceptron as ptr, my first repository.

Compile with gcc textptr.c -o textptr -lm and invoke with ./textptr "Testing", for example.

This is still a work in progress. It is real easy to drive into misinforming myself. You have to learn to back off and try more cleverness to get a result
that feels true.

I need your help on this one, let's make a small commuity for debunking text misinformation, the best we can.
